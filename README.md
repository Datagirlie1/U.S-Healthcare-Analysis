### Introduction
This data Analysis was created using Power BI to explore healthcare patterns across U.S. hospitals between 2019 and 2024. It focuses on patient demographics, treatment costs, common medications, and types of hospital admissions.

### Tools

- Excel for cleaning
- PowerBi for visualizations

 ### Data cleaning and transformation Process

  Before conducting the analysis, I performed the following task:
  -  Reviewed data from errors and missing values and inconsistency
  -  Checked for duplicate values and removed it
  -  created standardized date format.


   ### Objectives.
   
  -   Analyze Patients admitted over the past two years
    
  -    examined the medical conditions diagnosed
    
  -    Evaluate patients by insurance provider

  -    Analyzed the total patients by Gender
   
-	Examined blood types among different patients

-	Understanding the cost of treatment by condition


-	Analyzed the prescribed medication by condition

-	Analyzed the different admission type of patients

-	provide actionable insight and recommendations

   
### key findings.

  -  The analysis findings are summarized as follows:

  -  Most Common Blood Type: A+ lead, followed by O+ and O-
  -  Age Distribution: Patients in their 30s to 70s dominate the data, with a steady range around 8,000 patients per group.

  -   Younger patients (below 20) are much fewer, especially those under 10.
   -   Medications like Lipitor, Ibuprofen, Aspirin, and Paracetamol are the most commonly prescribed, all hovering around 11,000 prescriptions.
    -   Top 3 Conditions by Conditions: 
    -   Hypertension: $355M
    -   Diabetes: $354M
    -  Obesity: $327M
    -   These figures show the financial weight of managing chronic diseases in the U.S. Cancer, Arthritis, and Asthma follow, but at noticeably lower costs.
    
    
   
   ### Recommendations.
      
   -   Based on the Analysis, I will recommend the following recommendations:
   
   -   Preventive Health Focus
Since hypertension, diabetes, and obesity take up the largest portion of spending, health campaigns and preventive care for these conditions could reduce future costs.


   -  The nearly equal distribution of elective, urgent, and emergency admissions shows that hospitals must stay well-staffed and resourced for all types of care at all times.


   -   Tailored Medication Strategy
With common medications used across thousands of patients, optimizing drug supply chains and generic alternatives could reduce cost and improve efficiency.

  
   -  Target Younger Age Groups
The data shows very few younger patients. It may be worth investigating whether this is due to low need, low access, or lack of data.
